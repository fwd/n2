  <b>Nano.to Command Line Interface (CLI)</b><br />
  <!-- <sub>>_ Easy to use CLI prompts to enquire users for information‚ñå</sub> -->
</p>

<br />

* **Simple**: prompts has [no big dependencies](http://npm.anvaka.com/#/view/2d/prompts) nor is it broken into a [dozen](http://npm.anvaka.com/#/view/2d/inquirer) tiny modules that only work well together.
* **User friendly**: prompt uses layout and colors to create beautiful cli interfaces.
* **Promised**: uses promises and `async`/`await`. No callback hell.
* **Flexible**: all prompts are independent and can be used on their own.
* **Testable**: provides a way to submit answers programmatically.
* **Unified**: consistent experience across all [prompts](#-types).
